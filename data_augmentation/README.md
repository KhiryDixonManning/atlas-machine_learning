Data augmentation is a technique in machine learning that increases the size and variety of a training dataset without gathering new real-world data. It works by creating altered versions of existing examples through different transformations—such as rotating, flipping, or cropping images, or making slight changes to wording in text. By introducing these variations, models are exposed to a broader range of inputs, which helps them generalize better to new, unseen data. As a result, data augmentation reduces overfitting and improves overall model performance without the need for additional data collection.
