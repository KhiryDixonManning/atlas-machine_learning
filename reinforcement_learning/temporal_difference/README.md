Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make sequential decisions in an environment to maximize cumulative 1  rewards. This learning often occurs through trial and error, where the agent takes actions and observes subsequent states and rewards. Monte Carlo learning is one method, requiring the agent to complete an entire episode before updating its value estimates based on the actual total rewards received. In contrast, Temporal Difference (TD) learning updates its value estimates incrementally, bootstrapping from its own predictions of future rewards at each step. This allows TD methods to learn online and from incomplete episodes, often making them more efficient than Monte Carlo for many problems.
